## Problem / Motivation

<!-- Describe the problem you're trying to solve or the user experience you want to improve. -->

## Proposed Solution / Feature

<!-- Clear description of the feature. If UI-related, describe changes to the Lovelace card components or configuration options. -->

## Printer Model Scope

<!-- Which printer models does this apply to? (e.g., K1 family, K2 family, Ender 3 V3, all) -->

## Telemetry / Data Source

<!-- If this relies on telemetry fields, list them (e.g., `realTimeFlow`, `boxTemp`, new WS field name if known). Include sample frames if available. -->

## UI / Configuration Changes

<!-- New or changed card config keys or integration options (suggest names): -->

```
Example:
show_target_chamber_temp: true
preview_refresh_interval: 5
```

## Alternatives Considered

<!-- List any alternative approaches and why they are less optimal. -->

## Backward Compatibility

<!-- Does this change affect existing entity IDs, unique IDs, or options? How do we avoid breaking dashboards? -->

## Performance / Risks

<!-- Any latency, load, or resource concerns? Does this add polling or external calls? (Should remain local-only.) -->

## Additional Context / Mockups

<!-- Add sketches, JSON examples, or screenshots that help illustrate the request. -->

## Checklist

- [ ] I confirmed this is not already implemented
- [ ] I searched existing issues and discussions
- [ ] I described printer model scope
- [ ] I considered backward compatibility
- [ ] I avoided requiring cloud services or heavy dependencies
